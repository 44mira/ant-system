# Ant System

Implementation for the Ant System Algorithm.

## Usage

```bash
python ant-system.py [ <iterations> ]
```

- Iterations is an optional parameter that sets the number of iterations to be ran.
- The rest of the parameters (such as `alpha`, `beta`, and `ant-count`) have to be modified within the code itself.
